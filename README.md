# Worker Management App

This application is a simple worker management tool built with React. It allows users to add workers with details like name, surname, gender, and wage, and also to delete workers from the list. The app ensures data validation to maintain accurate worker information and prevent missing or incorrect details.

## Features

- **Add New Workers**: Users can add new workers to the list by filling out a form with the following details:
  - Name
  - Surname
  - Gender (Male/Female)
  - Wage (must be higher than a predefined minimum wage)

- **Form Validation**: The form ensures that all fields are properly filled before submitting:
  - Name and surname are required.
  - Gender selection is mandatory (radio buttons for Male or Female).
  - The wage must be greater than or equal to the minimum wage (5000 by default).

- **Error Handling**: If any field is missing or invalid, the user is shown an error modal with a relevant message, ensuring that they fill the form correctly.


## Technologies Used

- **React**: The core framework used for building the app.
- **CSS/ Tailwind**: Used for styling the components.
- **State Management**: Handled using Reactâ€™s `useState` hook.
- **Error Modal**: A reusable modal component to display error messages and confirmations.
